# Slack Clone App - Frontend (Rebuild Branch)

> ⚠️ **ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH** - This branch (`rebuild`) is under heavy development. Features are incomplete and APIs are being restructured.

**Note:** This is a bootcamp project requirement to build a **Slack-inspired messaging application**. While functionality is similar to Slack (channels, messaging, etc.), this is a **custom implementation with original UI/design** built for learning full-stack development.

### Current Focus:

- **Building Rails API backend** (separate repository)
- **Updating frontend** to work with new custom API
- **Replacing previous third-party API** with self-hosted solution
- **Refactoring** codebase for better maintainability

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React with Hooks
- Context API for state management
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Custom CSS styling

**Backend (Separate Repo):**
- Ruby on Rails (API mode)
- PostgreSQL database
- JWT token-based authentication

## 🔧 What's Happening Here?

I'm rebuilding the entire backend architecture:
- 🔄 **Replacing** third-party API with custom Rails API
- 🏗️ **Refactoring** frontend to work with new backend
- 🧪 **Experimenting** with new features and implementations
- 📚 **Learning** full-stack development through hands-on practice

## 🤔 Want to See Progress?

You can browse the code, but expect:
- Unfinished components
- Hardcoded values and mock data
- Incomplete features
- Frequent breaking changes
- Experimental code patterns

## 📍 For Stable Version

If you're looking for a working version, please check:
- The `master` branch (previous working version with third-party API)
- Or wait for this rebuild to be completed
